### `Experimental setup` [1]
![zone](https://github.com/yangxiuzhu777/Multi-Radar-Dataset/blob/main/pic/zone%20A%26B.png) 

### `Scenario 1`、`Scenario 2`

```Scenario 1```：A person sits in Zone A, keeping stil or with arms and legs moving randomly; a person stands in Zone B, performing four different body movements, including keeping still, arms and legs moving randomly, the upper body waggling back and forth, and turning left and right periodically.

```Scenario 2```：A person lies down in Zone A, keeping stil or with arms and legs moving randomly; a person sits in Zone B, performing four different body movements, including keeping still, arms and legs moving randomly, the upper body waggling back and forth, and turning left and right periodically.

-  In addition: The multi-radar dataset with an FMCW and two IR-UWB radars is constructed in a 1.5 meters × 2 meters cotton tent at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.  Four volunteers participate in the experiments, and a total of 192 minutes × 3 radars data are collected in these two scenarios. Due to the storage limit of Github, this project only includes two IR-UWB radars data in  Scenarios 1 and 2. Please contact the email yangxiuzhu@bupt.edu.cn for FMCW radar data if you need.
